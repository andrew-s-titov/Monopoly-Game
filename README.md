# Monopoly-Game

This is my own pet-project - online Monopoly game.  
Here I'm trying to develop both backend and frontend, using Java and Spring for the first and HTML, CSS and Javascript for the second.

Almost all main game features and rules are already implemented.  

For now, only one gaming room is available for players (max of 5 players at a time).  
Most of the communication between frontend and backend happens through Websocket for real-time view changes for all connected players (clients) and for an in-game chat.

P.S.  
Currently, I don't have any deep JavaScript knowledge as I haven't studied it anywhere, so I decided that practice is the best way of learning.  
Because of that frontend might look a bit rough, but that will be fixed as soon as possible.
